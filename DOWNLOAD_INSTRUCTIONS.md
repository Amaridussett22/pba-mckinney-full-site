# How to Download Your Website Files

## üì• Getting Your Website Files

Since your website is currently running on this development server, here are the best ways to get the files to your computer for editing:

### Method 1: Create a ZIP Archive (Easiest)

I can create a ZIP file of your entire website that you can download:

1. **Request ZIP file**: Ask me to create a downloadable ZIP
2. **Download**: I'll provide a download link
3. **Extract**: Unzip on your computer
4. **Start editing**: Follow the editing guide

### Method 2: GitHub Repository (Recommended for Long-term)

Set up a GitHub repository for version control and easy updates:

1. **Create GitHub account**: Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. **Create new repository**: Name it "pro-black-belt-academy"
3. **Upload files**: Use GitHub's web interface or Git commands
4. **Clone locally**: Download to your computer for editing

### Method 3: Copy Individual Files

For quick edits, you can copy specific files:

**Most Important Files to Edit:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Homepage content
- `app/payment/page.tsx` - Pricing and membership plans
- `app/blog/page.tsx` - Blog posts and news
